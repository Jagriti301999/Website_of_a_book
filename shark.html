The main idea of this book is about a girl and a boy fighting for their life and freedom. The author's purpose of this book is to show you how government control can affect us in real life and how the future could look, by showing it in a story through the eyes of Katniss and Peeta, a couple from District 12.</p>
<p class="para3">In my Opinion,it is an awesome book to read for people who like romance, betrayal, and most of all, rebellion.Katniss and Peeta have a lot of loyalty to each other. The fact that they were the last ones standing and they werenâ€™t going to kill each other, but die together by eating poisonous berries at the same time in the first book Hunger Games. </p>
